		<p><strong>Gpt Partition Table</strong>. Rem DISKPART script for single disk dual boot rem OS. Its a new standard thats gradually replacing MBR. You can change a disk from a GPT to an MBR partition style as long as the disk is empty and contains no volumes. The 64 bit Windows operating system uses 16384 bytes or 32 sectors as the GPT partition table.</p>
