<p>MySQL HASH partition is used to distribute data among a predefined number of partitions on a column value or expression based on a column value. Thanks for your help Chris. From MySQL 8016 when insertions deletions or updates are made to partitioned tables the binary log records information about the partition and if any the subpartition in which the row event took place. We can translate the partition word used in MySQL and advanced DBMS systems as division and separation. From EXPLAIN you can use PARTITIONS or EXTENDED but not both. The PARTITIONS keyword adds a partitions column to the output of EXPLAIN listing the partitions from which records would be matched by the query.</p>
