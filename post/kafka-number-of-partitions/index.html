		<p><strong>Kafka Number Of Partitions</strong>. Kafka-topicssh &ndash;describe &ndash;zookeeper localhost2181 &ndash;topic topic_name. For example if you want to be able to read 1 GBsec but your consumer is only able process 50 MBsec then you need at least 20 partitions and 20 consumers in the consumer group. Click a topic to view its details. If we have increased the number of partition then we can run the multiple parallel jobs on the same Kafka topic.</p>

<p>We cannot define the n number of the partition to the Kafka topic. Each message in a partition is assigned and identified by its unique offset. Here is the command to increase the partitions count from 2 to 3 for topic my-topic -binkafka-topicssh &ndash;alter &ndash;zookeeper localhost2181 &ndash;topic my-topic &ndash;partitions 3. Here is a quickie. You can change the partition quantity by performing the following steps on Kafka Manager. In Kafka a topic can have multiple partitions to which records are distributed.</p>
