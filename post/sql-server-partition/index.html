<p>In SQL Server there are two types of table partitions. PARTITION BY clause with ROW_NUMBER We can use the SQL PARTITION BY clause with ROW_NUMBER function to have a row number of each row. That is to say that based on one column the complete row will flow to partition 1 or 2 etc. Dividing table into multiple tables is called Horizontal Table Partition. Here is the code to create these objects and check some of their metadata in the system views. When a partitioned table or index is partitioned its data is divided into units that can be spread across more than one filegroup.</p>
