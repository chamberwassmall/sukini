		<p><strong>Sql Server Group By Over Partition</strong>. Let us rerun this scenario with the SQL PARTITION BY clause using the following query. The Row_Number function is used to provide consecutive numbering of the rows in the result by the order selected in the OVER clause for each partition specified in the OVER clause. The PARTITION BY clause divides a querys result set into partitions. SQL PARTITION BY clause overview The PARTITION BY clause is a subclause of the OVER clause.</p>
