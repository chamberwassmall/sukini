		<p><strong>Postgresql Count Over Partition</strong>. Select id_element week_nb sum first_row_in_sequence over partition by id_element as distinct_week_nb_count from select id_element week_nb case when row_number over partition by id_element week_nb 1 then 1 else 0 end as first_row_in_sequence from test as sub. In a database of transactions spanning 1000s of entities over 18 months I would like to run a query to group every possible 30-day period by entity_id with a SUM of their transaction amounts and COUNT of their transactions in that 30-day period and return the data in a way that I can then query against. Query performance can be increased significantly. When an asterisk is used.</p>
