		<p><strong>Master Boot Record Guid Partition Table</strong>. MBR Master Boot Record and GPT GUID Partition Table are two different ways of storing the partitioning information on a drive. Master Boot Record MBR disks use the standard BIOS partition table. If the disk does not contain any partitions or volumes skip to step 6. It is the latest style of disk partitioning and is known to be a quick successor of MBR.</p>
